# credit-risk-classification
Open the notebook and complete the following steps:

Read the lending_data.csv data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame.

Create the labels set (y) from the “loan_status” column, and then create the features (X) DataFrame from the remaining columns.

Split the data into training and testing datasets by using train_test_split.

Use your knowledge of logistic regression to complete the following steps:

Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (X_train and y_train).

Save the predictions for the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (X_test) and the fitted model.

Evaluate the model’s performance by doing the following:

Generate a confusion matrix.

Print the classification report.

Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?
